# Berlin Park Accessibility Analysis Report

## Introduction
This analysis examines the availability, size, and accessibility of parks across Berlin’s districts (*Bezirke*) and sub-districts (*Ortsteile*). It aims to identify spatial disparities in green space distribution and accessibility for residents in 2024.

---

## 1. Park Counts and Distribution at District Level
- **Spandau** has the highest number of parks (22), despite having a lower population density compared to districts like Pankow or Mitte.
- **Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg**, one of the more densely populated districts, has the lowest number of parks (6), which may indicate pressure on existing green spaces.
- The number of parks does not consistently correlate with population size, highlighting potential inequalities in park distribution across districts.

---

## 2. Park Counts by Sub-District (Ortsteil)
- **Marzahn** (in Marzahn-Hellersdorf district) leads with the highest number of parks (6), demonstrating strong park presence.
- **Mitte** (Mitte district) and **Kreuzberg** (Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg) follow closely, each with 5 parks.
- Other notable Ortsteile such as Köpenick, Prenzlauer Berg, Moabit, and Westend also have relatively high park counts (3–4 parks).
- Approximately 38% of Ortsteile (36 sub-districts) have no parks at all, including prominent areas like Hansaviertel (Mitte) and Gropiusstadt (Neukölln), indicating uneven distribution of park facilities.

## 3. Park Area per Capita by District and District Level
- **Spandau** (17.88 sqm/person) and **Marzahn-Hellersdorf** (16.05 sqm/person) offer the most park area per resident, highlighting good green space availability.
- Districts like **Steglitz-Zehlendorf** and **Reinickendorf** also provide substantial park area (>9 sqm/person).
- Conversely, **Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg** and **Neukölln** have the lowest park area per capita (<2.5 sqm/person), suggesting a need for increased green space investment.
- **Wannsee (Steglitz-Zehlendorf)** leads with 157.84 sqm park area per capita, while many sub-districts in **Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, Neukölln, Lichtenberg, and Reinickendorf** have very low or zero green space per person.

---

## 4. Park Accessibility Coverage
- The highest accessibility coverage is found in **Mitte** (~97%), followed by **Neukölln** (~90%) and **Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg** (~87%).
- Most districts exceed 60% coverage of their area within an 800-meter buffer of parks.
- However, **Treptow-Köpenick** stands out with only 40% coverage, signaling a lack of accessible parks for many residents.

---

## Conclusion
This comprehensive analysis reveals notable disparities in park availability and accessibility across Berlin’s urban fabric. While some districts and sub-districts enjoy ample and accessible green spaces, others face significant shortages. These insights underscore opportunities for targeted urban planning to enhance equitable access to parks, improve residents’ quality of life, and promote sustainable city growth.

---

## Next Steps
- Further analysis could include demographic overlays to assess which populations are most underserved.
- Incorporating park quality and facilities data will provide a more nuanced understanding of green space value.
- Engaging with local communities to prioritize park development projects in low-access areas.
